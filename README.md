## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter installed ([Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- An API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### Api keys
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your TMDB api key as follows:
```
API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```
### ⚠️ Key Considerations
- API Key Security: Using a `.env` file in mobile applications is not recommended as API keys can be extracted from the app.
- Best Practices:
  - Use backend proxy servers to securely fetch data and avoid exposing API keys in the frontend. 
  - If you must store API keys in the app, consider obfuscation techniques, but this is not foolproof. 
  - Use Firebase Functions or your own backend as an intermediary to handle API requests securely.
